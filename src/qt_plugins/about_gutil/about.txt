GUtil is a library of useful functions that is designed to make development much easier.  By encapsulating complex and tedious functions it gives you a toolbox of objects you can use right away to develop more complex, high-level behaviors.

It was developed entirely by George Karagoulis, mostly while he was in the process of developing other open-source initiatives.  Whenever he identified a useful piece of code he added it to the ever-growing library to make future applications go more quickly.

The library is protected by the Apache license 2.0, details of which can be found in the software package that built this application.
